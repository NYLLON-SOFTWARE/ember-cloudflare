# Self-hosting Ember

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/NYLLON-SOFTWARE/ember-cloudflare)

Everything about running your own Ember: deploying it, the settings an administrator turns on, what it
costs, and where it keeps messages. The [README](../README.md) has the short version, and
[Development](development.md) covers working on the code.

The button copies this repository to your GitHub or GitLab account and deploys it to your Cloudflare
account, as [Deploying](#deploying) describes.

## Deploying

The Deploy to Cloudflare button at the top asks you to name the repository, the Worker and the R2
bucket for files (turn R2 on for your account first), then Cloudflare's Workers Builds builds and
deploys it, and again after every push to the copy. There are no secrets to fill in. To deploy from
your machine instead, after `pnpm exec wrangler login`:

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm run deploy        # not `pnpm deploy`, which is pnpm's own command
```

Either way, `pnpm run deploy` (`apps/worker/scripts/deploy.ts`) makes the Worker's `SESSION_SECRET`
and a VAPID key pair for push notifications on its first deploy, and later deploys keep them, since
a new secret would sign everyone out and a new pair would end every push subscription. They go up
with the code and never appear in the deploy's output.

The first deploy also makes the Worker's setup token, `EMBER_SETUP_TOKEN`, and ends by printing the
setup link that carries it, `https://<your Worker>/first_run#token=<the token>`: in your terminal,
or in the build's log in the Cloudflare dashboard after Deploy to Cloudflare. Open it to set up
Ember. Only that link opens the form, so nobody who merely finds the address can make themselves the
administrator, and once Ember is set up the link is spent: setup closes for good, as in Campfire.
The token rides in the link's fragment, which no request or log sees. `/first_run` opened without it
says all this, and if the link is lost, make a new token, give it to the Worker, and open the link
with that one:

```sh
openssl rand -hex 32                              # the new token: keep it
pnpm exec wrangler secret put EMBER_SETUP_TOKEN   # asks for it; add --name <worker> for a Worker not named in wrangler.jsonc
```

On localhost, where `wrangler dev` serves, setup is open to whoever's there unless `.dev.vars`
sets a token.

The setup form suggests Kevin Rose and kevin@kevinrose.com for the administrator. To suggest your
own, set the Worker's `EMBER_SETUP_NAME_PLACEHOLDER` and `EMBER_SETUP_EMAIL_PLACEHOLDER` variables,
in `vars` in `wrangler.jsonc` for instance.

The administrator then signs in at `/session/new` with the email address and password they set up
with, and invites people with the join link on general's welcome card.

Ember insists on HTTPS, as Campfire does: plain HTTP is redirected to the same address over HTTPS,
and every answer from the Worker carries HSTS, except on `localhost` and loopback addresses, where
`wrangler dev` serves. Unlike Campfire's, it holds only the address it's given at to HTTPS, not the
names under it, which would be every name on a domain whose apex is Ember's custom domain. To serve
plain HTTP anywhere else, such as `wrangler dev --ip 0.0.0.0` for a phone on your network, set the
`DISABLE_SSL` variable to any value. `/up` answers 200 for uptime checks, as Rails' does, without
touching storage.

### A custom domain

Ember answers at its workers.dev address until an administrator gives it one of your own, under
Domain settings in Workspace settings, at the workers.dev address, and at any other with Move to another
domain. They type the address, `chat.example.com` say, and choose Set up, which first checks whether
the address already reaches Ember, as one added to the Worker before does, and then offers just Save.
Otherwise it asks Cloudflare's resolver for the zone the address is in, `example.com`, and whose
nameservers serve it, and picks that provider in the DNS provider menu, or Cloudflare when it can't
tell. Ember holds no Cloudflare token to
add the address itself, since a token that can add a domain to the Worker can also deploy new code to
it, so the steps open the dashboard, copying what to paste there. With Cloudflare chosen:

1. If DNS found the domain at another provider, move its DNS to Cloudflare, which is free and copies
   its records, since a Worker's Custom Domain must be on a domain whose DNS Cloudflare runs, in the
   account that runs the Worker. Open Cloudflare copies `example.com` and opens the dashboard's
   Domains, where Onboard a domain takes it and names two nameservers, and the next step says where
   that provider takes them.
2. Once the domain is active on Cloudflare, add the address as a Custom Domain of Ember's Worker: Open
   Cloudflare copies `chat.example.com` and opens the Worker's Domains tab, from the workers.dev address
   Ember remembers being opened at, where Add Domain takes it. Cloudflare makes the DNS record and the
   certificate.
3. Use chat.example.com, which asks the address from the Worker for a one-time probe only this Ember
   answers, makes it Ember's address once it does, and opens Workspace settings there. Until then it
   says nothing answers there yet, or that something else does, so Ember is never sent to an address
   that doesn't reach it.

With any other provider chosen, the domain's DNS stays there, and the steps are those of
[When the domain's DNS is elsewhere](#when-the-domains-dns-is-elsewhere), ending with the same Use.

From then on, a page opened at any other address moves to the same page at the new one, and the bot
API's links name it. Everyone signs in once more there, since a session belongs to its address, and
turns notifications on again, which replaces their browser's subscription at the old address. Bots
and webhooks go on posting to the addresses they were given.

Moving to another domain takes the same steps, and Go back to the workers.dev address makes it
Ember's address once more, once the Worker finds Ember still answers there. Either way, every other
address sends people to Ember's, the domain it left included: that domain reaches Ember until it's
removed on the Worker's Domains tab, which only the dashboard does. So Custom domain names the domains
Ember moved away from, links to that tab, and checks each until it's gone. Workspace settings stay
wherever they're opened, so if Ember's domain ever stops reaching it, open Domain settings at the
workers.dev address and go back there. Deploys leave the domain alone as long as `wrangler.jsonc` lists no
`routes`.

#### When the domain's DNS is elsewhere

Cloudflare gives a Worker a Custom Domain only on a domain whose DNS it runs. To leave the DNS where
it is, Ember takes the address through Cloudflare for SaaS instead, as Set up's steps say once
another provider is chosen in the DNS provider menu. That takes another domain already on Cloudflare
in the account that runs Ember, `example.net` say, which the steps ask for, and a payment method,
though the first 100 addresses are free. In the Cloudflare dashboard, on example.net:

1. Under DNS, Records, add a proxied `AAAA` record, `ember-saas`, for `100::`, an address that goes
   nowhere.
2. Under SSL/TLS, Custom Hostnames, enable Cloudflare for SaaS, make `ember-saas.example.net` the
   Fallback Origin unless example.net has one already, and add `chat.example.com` with HTTP
   validation. Keep a Fallback Origin that's there: replacing it would send example.net's other custom
   hostnames to `100::`, and the route below takes chat.example.com to Ember whatever it is.
3. Under Workers Routes, route `chat.example.com/*` to Ember's Worker, and
   `chat.example.com/.well-known/*` to no Worker, so that Cloudflare itself answers the certificate
   authority when it issues and renews the address's certificate. A route for `*/*`, as Cloudflare's
   guide suggests, would send all of example.net to Ember.

Then, at example.com's DNS provider, add a `CNAME` record named `chat` for `ember-saas.example.net`,
which the steps say where each provider adds. That record is why the address must be a name under
the domain, such as chat.example.com: example.com itself can't be a CNAME. Once Custom Hostnames shows
the address and its certificate active, Use chat.example.com makes it Ember's address.

### Who can join

New people join with the join link until an administrator changes how under Who can join, in
Workspace settings' Membership, where each way has a switch:

- Open, off until it's turned on, lets anyone create an account at `https://<Ember's address>/join`,
  which the sign-in page links to as Create an account. Nobody checks that an email address is the
  owner's. Until Ember has Turnstile's keys, below, each network can sign up 5 people an hour, and
  once 50 people have joined in an hour, however they joined, signing up waits, so a flood can't use
  up the rows Workers Free writes in a day.
- Join link, on until it's turned off, lets in anyone with the link. Off, the link sends people to
  sign in, and on again, it's the same link.
- Email domain, off until it's turned on, lets in people with an email address at the domains an
  administrator lists, such as their company's. They ask for a link at
  `https://<Ember's address>/join/email`, which the sign-in page offers as "Have an address at
  example.com? Join with it", and Ember emails them one that joins with that address, once, within
  an hour, so turning it on before Ember can send email sets that up first, below. Ember emails an
  address at most 3 times an hour, whoever asks, links and the codes that [reset a forgotten
  password](#resetting-a-password) together, so nobody can fill someone's inbox with them, counting
  only the emails the provider takes, and until Ember has Turnstile's keys, each network can ask for
  10 links an hour. Each link is an email, so the provider's limits apply.
- Memberful, below, lets in the members of a Memberful site, who sign in with their Memberful
  accounts while everyone else keeps a password. Its Members only switch keeps signing in to them
  and administrators.

While Open is on, Join link, Email domain and Memberful are set aside, keeping their settings, and
while Memberful is members only, Open, Join link and Email domain are, so Open and Members only can't
both be on. With all four off, only the people administrators invite by email, below, can join.

To have open sign-up, Email domain's page and the page for a forgotten password check that whoever
uses them is a person, an administrator sets up [Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/),
which is free, by turning on the switch on Membership's Turnstile card, or with Set up Turnstile, under
the limits Open and Email domain say. It links to Turnstile in the Cloudflare dashboard, where they add a widget for
Ember's hostname in Managed mode, then takes the widget's site key and secret key and draws its check.
Once the check passes, Ember asks Cloudflare whether the secret key is the same widget's, and keeps
both, the secret key encrypted. Turning the card's switch off takes them away.

The sign-up page, Email domain's and the forgotten password page then show Turnstile's check, and the
Worker asks Turnstile about each form before it makes the account or emails the link or code, in place
of the limits on a network, which a room full of people on one network, or a launch, would soon reach.
Signing in has no check, so that one that doesn't load never locks anyone out; it has its own limit.

A deployment can give the Worker a widget's keys as secrets instead, which take the place of any given
in Membership, whose card then names them:

```sh
pnpm exec wrangler turnstile widget create Ember --domain chat.example.com --mode managed
pnpm exec wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY     # add --name <worker> for a Worker not named in wrangler.jsonc
pnpm exec wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY
```

`pnpm run deploy` uploads the two when its environment has them, as it does Memberful's keys, so the
Preview workflow passes repository secrets of the same names through.

### Memberful sign-in

The members of a [Memberful](https://memberful.com) site can join and sign in with their Memberful
accounts instead of passwords. It's off until an administrator turns it on under Memberful in
Workspace settings, which walks them through it:

1. In Memberful, under Settings, Custom applications, add an app with Include OAuth tokens with
   this application checked, choose Server-side, and give it the OAuth redirect URL
   `https://<Ember's address>/auth/memberful/callback`. Leave Memberful's automatic sign-in off,
   since it skips the check that ties a sign-in to the browser that started it.
2. Give the Worker the app's keys as secrets: `MEMBERFUL_URL`, the site's address, such as
   `https://example.memberful.com`, and the app's OAuth identifier and client secret as
   `MEMBERFUL_CLIENT_ID` and `MEMBERFUL_CLIENT_SECRET`. Each command asks for its value:

   ```sh
   pnpm exec wrangler secret put MEMBERFUL_URL      # add --name <worker> for a Worker not named in wrangler.jsonc
   pnpm exec wrangler secret put MEMBERFUL_CLIENT_ID
   pnpm exec wrangler secret put MEMBERFUL_CLIENT_SECRET
   ```

   Or add them under the Worker's Settings, Variables and Secrets in the Cloudflare dashboard, as the
   type Secret, since a deploy takes away plain text ones. `pnpm run deploy` uploads them too when its
   environment has them, so the Preview workflow passes repository secrets of the same names through.
3. So that a member whose membership lapses is signed out, not only kept from signing in again, add
   a webhook in Memberful under Settings, Webhooks that sends the member, subscription and order
   events to `https://<Ember's address>/webhooks/memberful`, and give the Worker the webhook's secret
   key and the app's API key, as the step above does the others:

   ```sh
   pnpm exec wrangler secret put MEMBERFUL_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   pnpm exec wrangler secret put MEMBERFUL_API_KEY
   ```
4. Turn on Memberful in Workspace settings.

While it's on, the sign-in page offers Member? Sign in with Memberful under its form. Someone with an
active subscription, or the all access pass, signs in as the person their Memberful account is
linked to, or else joins as a new member, in every open room, and everyone else joins and signs in
as before. Accounts are linked by the Memberful site and the member's id there, never by email
address, since Memberful lets anyone register an address without proving it's theirs: someone new
whose Memberful email address someone here has already is turned away, and asked to sign in with
their password. The site is `MEMBERFUL_URL`'s address, so keep it once people have signed in: at
another address, even the same site's, every member would be someone new. Turning Memberful off
stops anyone new joining with it, but whoever signed in with it has no password, so they keep
signing in with it, and the sign-in page keeps offering it, while the Worker has the keys.

Members only, under Memberful, keeps Ember to the site's members: the sign-in page offers Sign in
with Memberful in place of its form, Open, the join link and signing in with just a name are off,
and only administrators and the people they invite sign in with a password, who need no membership.
Sessions people have go on, and turning it off brings the other ways and passwords back.

While Memberful is members only, someone with an account from before connects their Memberful
account to it with their password: from the Memberful section of their profile, or as they sign in
with their password, which asks them to connect one until they have. Memberful sends them back
signed in as themselves, and from then on they sign in with Memberful, and their membership counts
as anyone's. A connection is good for one try within ten minutes, and a new password, theirs or a
reset, forgets the ones the old one started. Administrators, and the people they invite, can connect
one too, and sign in either way.

A member whose membership lapses can't sign in with Memberful again. With the webhook, they're suspended too: their
sessions end, their sockets close and their browsers' push subscriptions are forgotten, but their
rooms, private ones too, messages and role stay, and they're back as they were once it's renewed and
they sign in. Making an open room private leaves them out of it, as it does anyone not chosen. A
webhook only tells Ember whom to ask about: Memberful sends them in no particular order, so the
Workspace asks Memberful's API what that member's membership is now, and asks about everyone linked
once a day too, in case one never came. Administrators, and the people they invite, who need no
membership, are never suspended. Administrators see suspended members dimmed in Workspace settings,
where they can remove them, and everyone else sees them as removed. All of this goes on whether
Memberful is on or not, since its members keep signing in with it once it's off.

### Sending email

Ember sends email with [Resend](https://resend.com), with an API key an administrator gives it, or
with [Cloudflare Email Service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/), which wrangler.jsonc
binds as `EMAIL`. Under Email, in Workspace settings' Membership, Set up email walks an administrator
through either, then the From address Ember's email comes from, under the community's name unless it
names another, and sends them a test email as it finishes, so that it checks itself. Turning
on Email domain, or Invite by email's Set up email, opens it too while Ember can't send email. Stop
sending email, beside it, takes the From address away, after which Ember emails nothing until email is
set up again.

With Resend, which sends 3,000 emails a month, at most 100 a day, for free, on Workers Free too:

1. Under Domains in Resend, add the domain to send from, and the DNS records it gives, until Resend
   says it's verified.
2. Under API Keys, create a key with Sending access, and paste it into Set up email. Ember asks Resend
   whether it takes the key, then keeps it in the workspace's settings encrypted with AES-GCM under a
   key derived from `SESSION_SECRET`, so a copy of the database alone doesn't give it away. A new
   `SESSION_SECRET` leaves it unreadable until an administrator pastes it again.

A Worker can have the key as a secret instead, which takes the place of one pasted in, leaving Set up
email only the From address to ask for:

```sh
pnpm exec wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY     # add --name <worker> for a Worker not named in wrangler.jsonc
```

`pnpm run deploy` uploads it when its environment has it, so the Preview workflow passes a
repository secret of the same name through.

With Cloudflare Email Service, in beta since April 2026:

1. Put the Cloudflare account that runs Ember on the Workers Paid plan, which includes 3,000 emails a
   month. On Workers Free it sends only to the account's own verified addresses.
2. In the Cloudflare dashboard, under Email Service, Email Sending, choose Onboard Domain and pick a
   domain on Cloudflare DNS, such as the one Ember's custom domain is on. Cloudflare adds the records
   sending takes.

Choosing Cloudflare Email Service in Set up email forgets a pasted Resend key. Once the From address
is typed, Set up email looks its domain up for the records Onboard Domain adds, the MX records on
`cf-bounce.<domain>` and the DKIM key at `cf-bounce._domainkey.<domain>`, and says whether it's
onboarded, with no Cloudflare API token, which Ember never holds. The records can't say whether the
account is on Workers Paid; the test email does. When the provider refuses it, Membership says why,
such as a domain that isn't onboarded or a day's quota used up. `wrangler dev` sends nothing with Cloudflare's binding: it logs each email and saves it to a
file.

### Inviting people by email

Under Invite by email, in Workspace settings' Membership, an administrator gives the email addresses
of the people to invite, and Ember emails each a link that joins with that address, once, within 7
days, whichever ways to join are on, Members only included. Until Ember can send email, the card
makes the links for the administrator to copy and send. The invitations nobody has accepted are
listed there, each to send again, which replaces its link, or revoke, and joining with an invited
address, however someone joins, spends its invitation. A link keeps its secret in the address's
fragment, which never reaches a server, and Ember keeps only its digest. Each invitation is an email,
so the provider's limits apply, such as Resend's 100 a day for free.

### Push notifications

Push notifications need a VAPID key pair, which the first deploy makes. `pnpm vapid:keys` prints a
new one as the Worker's two settings, for `.dev.vars` or to replace a deployment's:

```sh
pnpm vapid:keys
pnpm exec wrangler secret put VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY
pnpm exec wrangler secret put VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Without them push is off, and `/api/health` tells an administrator why. Keep the pair once people
use it: browsers subscribe with its public key, so a new pair leaves everyone to turn notifications
on again. A pair from Campfire's `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` and `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` works as it is.

A new message is pushed from its room's Durable Object as the room tells the Workspace of it, to the
subscriptions of the members who aren't viewing the room and want to hear of it: each person keeps
one for each browser they turned notifications on in, which saves it again each time Ember opens
there, and only the 10 saved most recently. Push services may contact whoever `VAPID_SUBJECT` names,
a `mailto:` or `https:` address, about your pushes; without it they see this project's address. Each
push is an outgoing request, of which the Workers Free plan allows 50 per invocation, so there the
pushes past that, for a message with more subscribers or a run of messages sent together, fail and
are logged; the Paid plan allows 10,000.

### Files

The files people upload go to an R2 bucket, bound as `FILES` in `wrangler.jsonc` and
named `ember`. Turn R2 on for your Cloudflare account, then deploy: Wrangler binds the account's
bucket of that name, and creates it if there's none and its token may, or make it yourself first
with `pnpm exec wrangler r2 bucket create ember`. Change `bucket_name` to use
another. `wrangler dev` keeps files on your machine. Without the binding Ember keeps no files, and
`/api/health` tells an administrator so.

A file goes up in parts of 10 MiB, since a Worker takes at most 100 MB a request, and R2 puts them
back together. R2 deletes the parts of an upload nobody finishes after a week.

### Ember AI

An administrator adds @ember, an AI assistant, on the AI assistant tab of community settings. Turning
on its Ember AI card opens Set up Ember AI, which takes a Cloudflare account's ID and an API token,
both from Workers AI's Use REST API in the Cloudflare dashboard, then a model. Ember asks models
through the account's default [AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/), whose
logs, caching and spend limits apply. Workers AI's models come with Cloudflare's free daily
allowance, and other companies', such as Anthropic's, OpenAI's and Google's, are paid for with AI
Gateway's credits, as [What it costs](#what-it-costs) says. The Worker asks the model a test question
before keeping the setup. @ember then joins every room open to everyone, and turning the card off
takes it out again and forgets the token. Nobody else can take the name Ember, though anyone who had
it keeps it.

Mention @ember in a room or a thread, or write to it in a DM, and it answers there: in the thread when
it's asked in one, typing while its model answers. It reads the thread, its first message and latest
50 replies, or else the room's latest 20 messages, each after its writer's name, at most about 40,000
characters of them, and sends them through AI Gateway to the model, whose provider reads them. Its
answer is a message of its own, in Markdown: links, bold, lists, quotes, code blocks and tables show as
they do in people's messages, the pictures it links to show in a card under it, and its first web link
gets a preview, as a pasted link does. It reads bots' messages but never answers one, so that bots
can't keep each other talking. When the model can't answer, as when the token is refused or the
credits run out, @ember says why in a short note, and the Worker's log has Cloudflare's own words.
AI Gateway's logs keep each request with the id of whoever asked, as custom metadata's `user_id`,
which a spend limit can be split by.

### A preview from GitHub Actions

The Preview workflow (`.github/workflows/preview.yml`) deploys `main` to a Worker named
`ember-production` on your workers.dev subdomain after every push, or when run by hand from the
Actions tab. It needs two repository secrets, and skips without them:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: a token made from the "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template.
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: under Account details on the Workers & Pages overview.

The first deploy makes the Worker's `SESSION_SECRET` and VAPID key pair, and later ones keep them;
they go up with the deploy, never in its logs. A public repository's Actions logs are public too, so
the workflow prints no setup link and makes no setup token: the Worker takes its token from an
`EMBER_SETUP_TOKEN` repository secret, if you add one (`openssl rand -hex 32`) before the first
deploy, and the run's log then says to open `<the preview>/first_run#token=<your token>` to set
Ember up. Without the secret, the deploy check says nobody can set the preview up until you deploy
it from a terminal with `pnpm run deploy --name ember-production`, which makes a token and prints
the link, or make one with `openssl rand -hex 32` and give it to the preview with
`wrangler secret put EMBER_SETUP_TOKEN --name ember-production`, which asks for it.

Repository variables named `EMBER_SETUP_NAME_PLACEHOLDER` and `EMBER_SETUP_EMAIL_PLACEHOLDER`, if
you add them, become the preview's setup form placeholders.

The preview is a private workspace, which its administrator invites people to with the join link.
Its version, under the sign-in page's card, is the commit it deployed. After each deploy,
`node apps/worker/scripts/check-deploy.ts <url>` checks, without signing in, that `/api/health`
answers (which needs `SESSION_SECRET`, and the Workspace and a room's Durable Object reading their
storage), that the page loads through the Worker with its headers, that the API asks for sign-in,
and whether Ember is set up yet, or waits for its setup link. `/api/health` tells strangers only
whether Ember is up; with the Worker's `EMBER_RECOVERY_TOKEN` in its environment, the check hears
which storage it uses too, and why when it's down. It sends the token only to an `https://` address,
or an `http://` one on this machine, and follows no redirect with it. The preview's link is on the
run's summary and under the repository's Deployments.

### A demo from GitHub Actions

The Demo workflow (`.github/workflows/demo.yml`), run by hand from the Actions tab, deploys `main` to
a Worker of its own, `ember-demo`, with its own R2 bucket, and has `pnpm seed`'s made-up team set it
up and talk, for people to try Ember without touching the preview. It takes the same two repository
secrets, and the bucket has to exist first: `pnpm exec wrangler r2 bucket create ember-demo`. Its
first run takes a setup token (`openssl rand -hex 32`) and everyone's password, which the run masks
in its log. Sign in as Maya Chen, its administrator, to find its join link in Membership, and pass that
on to whoever's trying it. A run without them brings the demo up to `main`'s code.

### Resetting a password

While Ember can send email, above, someone who forgot their password resets it themselves: the
sign-in page's "Forgot your password? Reset it" opens `https://<Ember's address>/passwords/new`,
where they give their email address, and Ember emails them an 8-digit code. The code works for 15
minutes, 5 tries and only until a newer one is sent, and with it they choose a new password, which
signs them in and ends their other sessions. The page says the same whether or not the address has an
account. Ember emails an address at most 3 times an hour, counting Email domain's links, and until
Ember has Turnstile's keys, each network can ask for 10 codes an hour. Each try of a code counts
against sign-in's limit, 10 tries from a network in 3 minutes.

Otherwise, someone who can't sign in gets a new password from `apps/worker/scripts/reset-password.ts`.
The Worker takes recovery requests only while its `EMBER_RECOVERY_TOKEN` secret is set, and the
script sends the same token from your shell's environment, so set one up just for the reset (add
`--name ember-production` to each `wrangler` command for the preview):

```sh
export EMBER_RECOVERY_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
printf %s "$EMBER_RECOVERY_TOKEN" | pnpm exec wrangler secret put EMBER_RECOVERY_TOKEN
node apps/worker/scripts/reset-password.ts https://<your Worker> ada@example.com
pnpm exec wrangler secret delete EMBER_RECOVERY_TOKEN
```

The script asks for the new password twice without showing it, or reads one line from stdin. All
the person's sessions end, with the sign-in links they showed, and their open tabs go to sign in.
Their browsers get no pushes until they sign in again. Their role and status stay as they
were, so someone deactivated or banned still can't sign in. Whoever has the token can take over any
account, so delete the secret once you're done; without it, the endpoint answers 404, as any
address the API doesn't have does.

### Security notes

What a self-hoster should know, beyond keeping the setup link to themselves:

- Every answer carries a `Content-Security-Policy` beside Rails' headers: scripts only from your
  Worker, images from any HTTPS site, since link previews show their page's image, and no page of
  Ember's in a frame elsewhere. When the policy gets in the way of something in a browser, the
  browser reports it to `/csp-report` and the Worker logs it, so look there if a page misbehaves.
- Link previews and bot cards show images from other sites, which load without a referrer: a site
  sees the reader's IP address, but not which Ember shows its image.
- An administrator can make a sign-in link for anyone, administrators included, which signs in as
  that person for 4 hours, more than once, while the session that showed it is still signed in as an
  administrator. Your own link works only while the session that showed it does, so signing out, a
  password reset, or a new password saved in another session ends it. Its id travels in the
  address's fragment, which no log sees.
- A file's address is signed and never expires: whoever has it can open the file until its message
  is deleted, as with Active Storage's links.
- A bot's webhook payload carries the bot's key, so point bots only at servers you trust. Webhooks
  go only to https, or to http on localhost, so nobody on the way reads the key; a bot saved with an
  http URL elsewhere before gets no deliveries until its URL is changed, and the Worker's log says
  why.
- Workers Logs record each request's address, which for Campfire's bot API and the Slack-compatible
  webhooks holds the bot's key and for the join link its code; Reset key and Regenerate join link are
  the remedies if a log is shared, and
  `"logs": { "invocation_logs": false }` under `observability` in `wrangler.jsonc` drops the
  per-request record.
- A new password takes at least 8 characters, at setup, on joining, in a profile or in a reset,
  though a shorter one set before keeps working. Passwords are kept as scrypt digests at OWASP's
  cost, which takes about a quarter of a second of CPU in a Durable Object of its own; digests from
  before scrypt are replaced as their passwords sign in.
- A session lasts until it goes 400 days unused. Changing your email address or password takes
  your current password, so holding someone's session isn't enough to take their account, and a new
  password ends your other sessions and forgets their browsers' push subscriptions. A password reset,
  deactivation or ban ends all of a person's sessions within a minute.
- Until Ember is set up, only the setup link the deploy printed opens the form, so finding a new
  deployment's address isn't enough to become its administrator; on localhost, and on a Worker
  without a setup token, setup is open or closed as [Deploying](#deploying) says.
- `EMBER_GUEST_SIGN_IN=true` lets anyone with the address in with just a name, so keep it to
  `wrangler dev`, as `.dev.vars.example` says.
- With Open on, anyone who finds the address can make an account, with any email address, and
  create rooms unless Must be admin to create new rooms is on. Turnstile, given its keys, keeps most
  bots out, and until then its limits keep a flood from filling the free plan. The join link has no
  limits, since its secrecy is the gate: regenerate it if it gets out.
- A Resend API key pasted into Set up email is kept encrypted, and never shown again, even to
  administrators: Membership says only that Ember has one. Make it a key with Sending access, as Resend
  suggests, so that one that got out could do no more than send email. A Turnstile secret key given in
  Set up Turnstile, and an API token given in Set up Ember AI, are kept the same way.
- A code to reset a password goes to the account's email address, so whoever reads mail there can
  take the account over, as on most sites. Nobody checks an address is its owner's when someone
  joins, unless they join with an invitation or Email domain, so someone could join with another
  person's address, whose owner could then reset its password. A code is kept only as its digest,
  and at 3 codes an hour and 5 tries each, guessing one would take centuries. The page answers before
  Ember emails anything, so neither what it says nor how soon tells who has an account.
- Email domain lets in whoever can read mail at its domains, so list only domains whose addresses
  your organization hands out: Membership warns of ones anyone can have an address at, such as
  gmail.com. Its page answers the same whether or not an address has an account, emailing someone
  who has one a way to sign in instead, so it tells strangers nothing of who's here.
- The Memberful site vouches for its members, so whoever runs it can sign in here as any of them who
  have, and while Memberful is on, add new ones. Administrators keep their passwords, so the site being down never locks
  them out. A webhook whose signature `MEMBERFUL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` doesn't check is refused, and even a
  signed one only has Ember ask Memberful's API about a member, so one forged or sent again changes
  nothing.
- Custom CSS runs on every page for everyone, so it's an administrator's to write, like the rest of
  the workspace, and `EMBER_RECOVERY_TOKEN` can take over any account, so keep it set only while
  resetting a password, as above.
- `/api/health` tells strangers only whether Ember is up; administrators and whoever sends the
  recovery token hear the rest. QR codes (`/qr_code/<id>`) are drawn for people signed in.

## What it costs

Ember is free, under the MIT license. What it runs on is Cloudflare's, at Cloudflare's prices, as its
pages had them in October 2026:

- **Workers Free** costs nothing, and Ember is built to fit it: its Durable Objects keep their data in
  SQLite, it needs no cron triggers, queues or KV, and it hashes passwords and fetches link previews in
  Durable Objects of their own, since a Worker's request gets only 10 ms of CPU there. The plan's
  allowances are daily, and reset at midnight UTC. The one Ember reaches first is the 100,000 rows a day
  that Durable Objects may write: as measured in October 2026, a message writes about 20 (13 in its
  room, 5 in the search index and 2 in the Workspace), opening a room about 5, a reaction 5, and signing
  in with a password 26. That's 3,000 to 5,000 messages a day, depending on what else people do: about
  100 people a day sending 30 messages each, 500 who send a few, or 30 who chat all day. Once a day's
  rows are written, Ember can't save anything new until midnight UTC. Durable Objects may keep 5 GB in
  all, and pushes past 50 at a time fail, as [Push notifications](#push-notifications) says.
- **Workers Paid** costs $5 a month for the whole Cloudflare account, not per person. Its allowances
  are monthly and far larger, such as 50 million rows written a month, and use past them is billed at
  Cloudflare's rates.
- **Files** go to R2, which stores 10 GB a month free, then charges $0.015 per GB a month, and never
  charges for downloads.
- **Email**, if Ember sends it: Resend's free plan sends 3,000 emails a month, at most 100 a day, and
  Cloudflare Email Service includes 3,000 a month on Workers Paid, as [Sending email](#sending-email)
  says.
- **Ember AI**, if it's on: Workers AI's models are free up to 10,000 Neurons a day on either plan, and
  Workers Paid bills past that at $0.011 per 1,000 Neurons. Other companies' models are paid for with
  AI Gateway's credits, at each provider's own per-token prices, plus a 5% fee on the credits bought.

## Storage: Durable Object SQLite or D1

`STORAGE_BACKEND` in `wrangler.jsonc` picks where messages live.

- **`do-sqlite`** (default): each room's Durable Object keeps its messages in its own SQLite
  storage. Nothing to provision, and reads and writes never leave the object.
- **`d1`**: messages go to one shared D1 database, which makes cross-room queries (activity,
  exports) straightforward. Create the database with `pnpm exec wrangler d1 create ember`,
  uncomment the `d1_databases` block, set `STORAGE_BACKEND` to `"d1"`, and apply
  `apps/worker/migrations/` with `pnpm --filter @ember/worker d1:migrate:local` (or `--remote`).

Both use the same schema (`apps/worker/migrations/`) and the same queries
(`apps/worker/src/store.ts`); only the driver (`apps/worker/src/db.ts`) differs. The Workspace
object's tables follow the same setting. The search index's don't: it keeps every room's messages in
one FTS5 table in the `SearchIndex` object's own storage, since D1 can't export a database that holds
one. [`docs/database.md`](database.md) compares them with Campfire's.
