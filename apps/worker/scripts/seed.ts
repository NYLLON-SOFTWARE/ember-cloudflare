// Fills a new Ember with a made-up team, Fernwood, and their conversations, to see Ember in use:
// threads, replies quoting what they answer, mentions, reactions, an edit, formatting and code, pictures, a
// video, files, link previews, DMs and bots' cards. It sets Ember up as the team's first person, so it
// takes only an Ember nobody has set up yet:
//
//   pnpm dev
//   pnpm seed                            # in another terminal, for http://localhost:5173
//   pnpm seed https://ember.example.com  # a deployment nobody has set up yet
//
// A deployment takes its setup password, in EMBER_SETUP_PASSWORD, or the setup token its deploy printed,
// in EMBER_SETUP_TOKEN. Everyone's password is
// EMBER_SEED_PASSWORD, or one the seed makes up and prints. To seed `pnpm dev`'s Ember again, stop it
// and delete apps/worker/.wrangler/state, which holds it.
