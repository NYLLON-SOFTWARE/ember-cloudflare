// Deploys the Worker with the secrets it doesn't have yet, so a new deployment works without anyone
// making them. Deploy to Cloudflare's build runs it as `pnpm run deploy`, and the Preview workflow
// runs it with its own options, which go on to `wrangler deploy`:
//
//   node apps/worker/scripts/deploy.ts [--name <worker>] [--config <file>] [--var NAME:value ...]
//
// Sessions are stored keyed with SESSION_SECRET, so changing it would sign everyone out: the first
// deploy makes one and later ones keep it. Browsers subscribe to push notifications with
// VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY, so the first deploy makes a VAPID key pair too, and later ones keep it. Whoever
// deployed, and nobody else, sets Ember up (apps/worker/src/setup.ts) with its setup password,
// EMBER_SETUP_PASSWORD, which Deploy to Cloudflare's form asks them to make up, or which the deploy's
// environment gives. A Worker with neither that nor a setup token gets EMBER_SETUP_TOKEN, the one secret
// meant to be read: the deploy prints the setup link that carries it, which is spent once Ember is set
// up. The secrets go up with the code in one `wrangler deploy --secrets-file`, from a file only this
// deploy can read, and nothing else here prints them: Cloudflare's build logs mask nothing, as GitHub's
// would. A CI log can be public, as a public repository's Actions logs are, so there the deploy makes no
// setup token, and says so, unless EMBER_SETUP_TOKEN in its environment brings one the deployer keeps as
// a secret of their own. Workers Builds' log is the account's own, so it can carry the link. The keys of
// a Memberful custom app, for its members to sign in (apps/worker/src/memberful.ts), and of a Turnstile
// widget, for open sign-up's check, in place of any given in Set up Turnstile (apps/worker/src/turnstile.ts),
// go up with every deploy whose environment gives them, as the Preview workflow's does from the
// repository's secrets. So does the ID of the Cloudflare account the Worker goes to, as
// CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID, which a Worker can't learn by itself, for Set up Ember AI to fill in. Deploy
// to Cloudflare's copy of Ember leaves out the .github folder, and with it the Update Ember workflow
// that offers the copy Ember's releases, so a deploy without that workflow ends by saying how to add it.
// A copy on GitHub tells the Worker its repository, the branch that deploys, and whether it has the
// workflow, as vars, for General's release card to link to running the workflow, or to adding it.
// Where STORAGE_BACKEND keeps messages in D1, the deploy makes the database the config names if the
// account has none, refuses one in which an Ember the Worker isn't bound to is set up, and applies
// Ember's migrations to it before the Worker that reads it deploys; on DO SQLite, it deploys without the
// D1 database that Deploy to Cloudflare's form makes for every copy.
