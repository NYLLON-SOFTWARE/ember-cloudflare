// connecting by name, so the address checked can't be pinned for the connection:
//
// - A name must resolve only to public addresses. ember-rust drops the blocked ones and connects to
//   the first public one, which here would let the connection pick a blocked one.
// - A host written as an address, in any of the notations `inet_aton` reads (`127.0.0.1`,
//   `2130706433`, `0x7f.1`, `[::1]`), is never fetched, public or not. Workers can't fetch one anyway.
