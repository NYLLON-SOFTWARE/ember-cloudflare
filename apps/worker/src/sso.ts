// Signing in with the single sign-on provider, by OpenID Connect's authorization code flow with PKCE

// provider's authorization endpoint with a random state, nonce and code verifier, which a cookie keeps,
// and the provider sends it back to the callback with that state and a code, which the Worker exchanges,
// with the app's secret and the verifier, for an ID token, checked against the provider's keys and the
// nonce, and a refresh token, kept sealed to ask the provider again about the account every hour. It
// works for any provider that publishes a discovery document, such as Zitadel, Keycloak, Authentik,
// Okta, Entra ID or Google. The provider signs people out with a back-channel logout
// (openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html). While single sign-on is the only way in,
// someone who has an account here already connects theirs as with Memberful (memberful.ts).
