// `$scrypt$ln=<log2 N>,r=<r>,p=<p>$<salt>$<hash>`. ember-rust uses bcrypt, which Workers could only
// run compiled to WebAssembly, where Node's scrypt runs natively, and scrypt is memory-hard where
// bcrypt and PBKDF2 aren't, so a guess costs an attacker's GPU about what it costs here. Digests from
// before scrypt, PBKDF2-SHA256 at the 100,000 iterations Web Crypto allows on Workers
// (`$pbkdf2-sha256$i=<iterations>$<salt>$<hash>`), still verify, and are replaced as their passwords
// sign in. Because each digest says how it was made, a stronger hash later is the same move again.
