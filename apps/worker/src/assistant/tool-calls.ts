// Tools Ember runs for a model. A model is given each tool's name, what it does and what it takes, and may
// answer with calls of them in place of an answer; Ember runs each and asks the model again, with what it
// said and what each call came to, until it answers. Each format writes all of that its own way:
// Anthropic's Messages (https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview), OpenAI's
// Responses, which xAI's has too (https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/function-calling), and
// Chat Completions, which Cloudflare's REST API takes Grok's requests in. Workers AI's models, asked in a
// format of their own, are given none of them (`takesEmbersTools`), and Grok, in Chat Completions, is given
// Ember's own for searching the web among them, while it may search (gateway.ts).
