// First run, which creates the workspace and its first administrator, at Campfire's paths, except that
// the form posts to /api/first_run. Whoever deployed Ember sets it up, and nobody else. Deploy to
// Cloudflare's form asks them to make up a setup password, EMBER_SETUP_PASSWORD, which the Set up Ember
// page asks for. A deploy from a terminal makes EMBER_SETUP_TOKEN instead, for a Worker with neither, and
// prints the setup link that ends in it (apps/worker/scripts/deploy.ts), which the page reads off the
// address's fragment. The page sends either as the form's bearer token, so the first stranger to find a
// new deployment can't make themselves its administrator, and tries at a setup password count against a
// limit for the whole deployment, so nobody can guess one either. There's no cookie, lock or expiry: setup
// closes once an administrator exists, which is all a setup password or link needs. Over loopback, where
// `wrangler dev` serves and nobody on the Internet can reach, a deployment with neither is open, as
// Campfire is.
