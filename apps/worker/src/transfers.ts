// Sign-in links, as Campfire's session transfers are: opening one signs that browser in as the person
// its id was made for, until it expires. Campfire's link is `/session/transfers/<id>`; this one keeps
// the id in its fragment (`transferLink`), and its page sends it in a request's body, so no address the
// Worker is asked for, nor Cloudflare's log of one, holds it. The id is a Rails signed id of the person;
// this one is their id, the session that showed it and when it expires, signed with SESSION_SECRET as
// avatar tokens are, so changing the secret ends every link, as changing Campfire's SECRET_KEY_BASE
// does. Unlike Campfire's, a link works only while that session is still signed in as someone who may
// show it: the person it's for, or an active administrator. So whatever ends a session, signing out, a
// password reset, a removal or a ban, ends the links it showed, and losing administrator rights ends the
// links an administrator showed of others.
