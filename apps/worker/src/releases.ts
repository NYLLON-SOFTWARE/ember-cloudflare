// that release's page, whose address ends in its tag, and that's all this asks of GitHub, rather than
// asking its API, whose limit of 60 requests an hour for each IP address the many Workers sharing one
// would spend. A repository that has moved redirects to its new address first. Each isolate keeps what
// GitHub said for six hours, and that it didn't say for ten minutes, before asking again, but a check
// made afresh, as opening Admin makes one, asks again sooner, as the project's owner asked (2026-11-05):
// once a minute has passed since the isolate last asked, so that going in and out of Admin can't keep
// asking. GitHub's latest release is never a pre-release, as Ember's betas are, so it's Ember's tags that
// say which beta is newest, as git lists them, the way `git ls-remote` asks, which GitHub answers apart
// from its API's limit. General offers a release the newest beta to try, once it's ahead of the newest
// release, and tells a beta of the next, then of its release (docs/self-hosting.md#betas).
