// Signing in with Memberful (`auth.memberful-sign-in`), this port's own, as ember-rust signs people in
// with passwords alone. Memberful speaks OAuth 2.0 but not OpenID Connect, so this follows its guide for
// a server-side custom app (memberful.com/docs/api-reference/sign-in-for-apps-via-oauth): Sign in with
// Memberful sends the browser to the site's `/oauth` with a random state, which a cookie keeps, and the
// site sends it back to the callback with that state and a code, which the Worker exchanges, with the
// app's client secret, for an access token to ask the member API who signed in. It works only while an
// administrator has turned Memberful sign-in on, and the deployment has the app's keys. Someone who has an
// account here already connects their Memberful account to it the same way (`auth.memberful-connect`),
// once their password has checked out, from their profile, or as they sign in: the Workspace keeps the
// state's digest for the callback, which connects the account to theirs.
