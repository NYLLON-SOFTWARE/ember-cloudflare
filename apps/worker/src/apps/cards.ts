// Slack shows such a card whole or not at all, so does Ember: one with a block Ember doesn't draw isn't
// shown, and the model, which has the tool's text either way, answers from that. A button on it whose
// `action_id` is `tool:` and a tool's name calls that tool of the same app when it's clicked, with the
// JSON object its `value` writes, and what the tool answers takes the card's place.
