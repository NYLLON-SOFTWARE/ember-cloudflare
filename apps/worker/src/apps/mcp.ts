// send Ember, or the token, anywhere else. Only JSON comes back, and none of a server's code runs here.
// Every request, the lookups of the name among them, ends at one deadline, as the client doesn't pass
// its own to all of them, and the answers together may be only so long, as the client reads each whole.
