// Signing in to an app whose server asks for one, with OAuth as the Model Context Protocol has it
// (https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization), through the protocol's own
// client. An administrator's browser goes to the app's authorization server and comes back with a code,
// which Ember exchanges for the token it then sends the server, and one to get another with when that
// ends. Ember is a public client that proves each exchange with PKCE: the authorization server reads
// who Ember is from the document Ember serves, where it reads one, or else Ember registers itself.
// Where it does neither, an administrator registers Ember there themselves, and gives Ember the client
// ID they got, with its secret, if it has one, which Ember then proves itself with as well.
// A server that refuses a call for want of a scope has that asked for at the next sign-in, with what
// the last one had, and removing an app takes its tokens back at the service, where it says how.
// Everything asked about a sign-in is asked the way an app's server is: over https, of names that
// resolve only to public addresses, without following a redirect to another host, within one deadline.
