-- Outside AI: the AI apps, such as Claude and ChatGPT, that people connect to Ember over the Model
-- Context Protocol, to read it as them. Each signs in with OAuth, where Ember is the authorization
-- server, which the Workspace keeps (scope "workspace" in src/migrations.ts).
--
-- outside_clients holds the apps that registered themselves (RFC 7591): the id Ember gave each, the
-- name it gave itself, and the addresses it may have a browser sent back to, a JSON array. An app
-- whose id is the address of a document about it has no row: Ember reads the document when it's asked.

-- A row of outside_connections is an app connected as one person: client_id and client_name say
-- which, redirect_uri where it had their browser sent back, scope what they allowed it, by scopes'
-- names with spaces between, and resource the address it said it connects to, if it said. A row
-- starts when its person allows the app, with the digest of the code the app is sent back with, the
-- challenge the app proves it began with, and when the code expires. Once the app has exchanged the
-- code, the row holds the digests of its access and refresh tokens, with when each expires, and of
-- the refresh token before this one, which nothing but a copy presents again. used_at says when the
-- app last asked Ember anything, to the hour. No token is kept, only its HMAC under SESSION_SECRET.
