-- made, unless it couldn't, or ember-rust can't resize a file of its type (src/files/pictures.ts).

-- picture reserves its key here first, due in an hour, and whatever gives someone the picture takes it
-- out in the same batch, so a picture nobody got, however its request ended, is deleted once the hour
-- is up. Replacing or removing an avatar puts the old one's key here, due at once. The Workspace's
-- alarm has R2 delete each key's file and variants (src/workspace.ts).
