-- How a room finds someone's messages (scope "room" in src/migrations.ts): `message.check` looks up a
-- sender's by the ids their client gave them, and banning someone deletes all of theirs, which
-- ember-rust finds through `index_messages_on_creator_id` (crates/db/src/schema.sql). One index
-- serves both, in place of migration 0002's, so a new message writes no more than it did.
