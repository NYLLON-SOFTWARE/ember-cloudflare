-- Unread marks, kept by the Workspace (scope "workspace" in src/migrations.ts). A membership's
-- unread_at is when the first message its person hasn't seen was written, where ember-rust keeps the
-- newest's, and null once they've read the room. A room's applied_seq is the last event of its change
-- log (migration 0010) that the Workspace has applied, so one delivered again changes nothing.
