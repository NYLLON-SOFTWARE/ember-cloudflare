-- Each browser's push subscription once, and each person's ten saved most recently, kept by the
-- Workspace (scope "workspace" in src/migrations.ts). ember-rust tells subscriptions apart by their
-- endpoint and both keys (crates/db/src/models/push_subscription.rs), so a browser saving other keys
-- adds one, and a message is pushed to every one: someone saving a subscription thousands of times, each
-- with keys of their own making, would have every message that notifies them pushed thousands of times.
-- A push service's endpoint names one browser's subscription, so here a person has each endpoint once,
-- saving it again replaces its keys, and saving past MAX_PUSH_SUBSCRIPTIONS (@ember/protocol), ten when
-- this was written, forgets the one saved longest ago. Of the subscriptions saved before, the one saved
-- most recently at each endpoint is kept, then each person's ten saved most recently.
