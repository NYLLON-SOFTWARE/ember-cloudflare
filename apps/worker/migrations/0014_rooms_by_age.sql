-- Rooms in the order they were made, kept by the Workspace (scope "workspace" in src/migrations.ts).
-- The workspace's first room is its oldest, as ember-rust's `Room::original` finds it
-- (crates/db/src/models/room.rs), and every sidebar asks which that is. Ids sort in the order rooms
-- were made, but the ids of rooms from before the Workspace kept a list (LEGACY_ROOMS) don't, so this
-- finds it at once rather than the primary key.
