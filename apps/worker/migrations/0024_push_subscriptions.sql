-- Push subscriptions, kept by the Workspace (scope "workspace" in src/migrations.ts): each browser that
-- turned notifications on for someone, with the keys its pushes are encrypted for and the browser's user
-- agent, as ember-rust's `push_subscriptions` keeps them (crates/db/src/schema.sql). Unlike there, the
-- endpoint and keys are required, and a person has each set once, so a browser saving its subscription
-- again is an upsert; the unique index also finds a person's subscriptions, as ember-rust's by person does.
