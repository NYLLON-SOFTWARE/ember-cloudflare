-- How often someone asked Ember lately to email each address a link to join with it, at the workspace's
-- email domains (`auth.email-domain-sign-up`), kept by the Workspace (scope "workspace" in
-- src/migrations.ts), this port's own: an address is emailed only so many times an hour, whoever asks,
-- so that nobody can have Ember email someone over and over. A count starts again once its hour is
-- over, and asking deletes the counts whose hour is. Only the emails sent, or being sent, are counted: an
-- ask past the limit isn't, nor an email the provider refuses.

  -- The address asked for, in lowercase, so that its case keeps no count of its own.
