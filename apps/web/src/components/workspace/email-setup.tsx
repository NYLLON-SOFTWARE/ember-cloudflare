// email, one at a time, in a dialog that Membership's Email card opens, as Invite by email does, and as
// turning on Email domain does before Ember can send email, as the project's owner asked (2026-10-26).
// First, what sends it: Resend, with an API key Ember checks with Resend and keeps, or Cloudflare
// Email Service, which delivers beyond the account's own addresses only on Workers Paid. Then the From
// address, whose domain it checks for the records Cloudflare's Onboard Domain adds, and then a test
// email, which it sends as it gets there, so that setting up checks itself. While the deployment has the
// secret RESEND_API_KEY, Resend sends with it, so it starts at the From address. Each step saves as it
// goes on. Styled as Unsaved Changes is.
