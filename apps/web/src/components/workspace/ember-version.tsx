// The Ember version card at the end of General, for administrators: the release this Ember is, and once
// GitHub names a newer one, that it's out, with its notes and how to update, as the project's owner
// asked (2026-10-31), while the rail's Admin has a dot. A copy made with Deploy to Cloudflare gets a pull
// request for each release once it has the Update Ember workflow, which Cloudflare's copy leaves out
// (docs/self-hosting.md#updating), and the docs say how anything else updates. Where the deploy told the
// Worker which copy on GitHub this is, the card links straight to running its workflow, as the project's
// owner asked (2026-11-05), or to adding it. A beta says it's one, ahead of the newest release, until its
// release is out, and is told of the beta after it as of an update (docs/self-hosting.md#betas). A release
// with nothing newer to update to is offered the newest beta to try, while one is out ahead of it, which it
// takes only when asked: a box of its own under the card links to running the copy's beta workflow, Update
// Ember to its newest beta, or to adding it, as the project's owner chose (2026-11-10), and the rail's Admin
// has no dot for it. The box is a little red, as he asked the same day, so the beta reads as experimental.
