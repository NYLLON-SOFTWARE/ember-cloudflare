// flash, keeping the email address and emptying the password. While Memberful is members only, the card
// offers signing in with Memberful instead, and the email and password form to those who ask for it:
// administrators, and members with an account from before, whose password then asks them to connect
// their Memberful account. Otherwise, while Memberful's members sign in with it, the card links to that
// under the form. Single sign-on works the same way, named as the provider is: while it's the only way
// in, the card offers Sign in with it instead of the form, and otherwise links to it under the form. While anyone may sign up, it links to the page for that, and it says why a way to join
// that's off sent someone here. While Ember can send email, the form links to resetting a forgotten
// password with a code Ember emails.
