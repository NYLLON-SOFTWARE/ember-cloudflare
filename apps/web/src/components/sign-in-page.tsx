// ember-rust's sign-in page (crates/views/templates/sessions/new.html, styled by the .mb-auth-* rules

// pull request #24 does in place of its flash, keeping the email address and emptying the password, as
// its page does when it's shown again. While Memberful is members only, this port's own, the card offers
// signing in with Memberful instead, and the email and password form to those who ask for it:
// administrators, and members with an account from before, whose password then asks them to connect their
// Memberful account. Otherwise, while Memberful's members sign in with it, the card links to that under
// the form. While anyone may sign up, it links to the page for that (`auth.open-sign-up`), and it says why a
// way to join that's off sent someone here (`accounts.ways-to-join`). While Ember can send email, the form
// links to resetting a forgotten password with a code Ember emails (`auth.password-reset`).
